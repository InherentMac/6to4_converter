# IPv4 to 6to4 Address Converter
Simple script to convert IPv4 addresses to 6to4 addresses.  See RFC 3056 for details.

## How to Use
IPv4 addresses are entered in the form x.x.x.x without a mask or CIDR. Equivalent 6to4 address will be given as output, with prefix.

This script must be ran with Python 3 and in the terminal, does not pause when outputting.


This script does not do any input error checking, so expect errors if an incorrect value is entered.
